### How FriendFinder Works
FriendFinder is a compatibility-based friend finding application. Similar to a dating app, this full-stack application creates a profile for each user based on their answers to a survey. It then compare their profile with those from other users. The app finds the person's closest match in the system and displays the name and picture of their recommended friend.
